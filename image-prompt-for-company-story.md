# Background Image Prompt for "Our Story" Section

## Image Description
Create a sophisticated, abstract technology-themed background image that represents a software company's journey and growth. The image should have the following characteristics:

## Style and Composition
- Modern, digital abstract style with a tech-focused aesthetic
- Subtle grid or circuit-like patterns in the background
- Flowing, dynamic lines representing growth and progress
- A sense of depth and dimension with layered elements
- Semi-transparent, overlapping geometric shapes

## Color Palette
- Primary background: Deep navy blue (#0a1929) as the dominant color
- Secondary colors:
  - Bright cyan blue accents (#00E5FF)
  - Electric blue highlights (#0072FF)
  - Deep purple elements (#6E00FF)
  - Subtle teal gradients (#20B2AA)
- All colors should have a slight luminous glow effect

## Technical Specifications
- Resolution: 1920x1080px (16:9 ratio)
- Format: PNG with transparency support
- Style: Digital illustration/3D render hybrid
- Finish: Smooth with subtle grain texture

## Mood and Feeling
The image should convey:
- Innovation and technological advancement
- Professional expertise and reliability
- Growth and forward momentum
- A sense of journey through time (from startup to established company)

## Elements to Include
- Abstract representations of code or data (not literal code)
- Subtle particle effects that suggest digital transformation
- Light trails that form a path through the composition (representing the company's journey)
- Areas of higher contrast/focus in the center-right area where text will be overlaid
- Floating geometric shapes (cubes, spheres, pyramids) that represent building blocks of technology
- Subtle network connection lines between elements

## Color Transitions
- The image should transition from deeper blues (#0a1929) at the bottom to slightly lighter blues (#102a43) at the top
- Accent colors should be distributed throughout but with higher concentration in the center-right area
- The glow effects should create a sense of energy and movement

## Texture Details
- Add a subtle digital noise texture throughout for depth
- Include faint binary code patterns in some areas (very subtle, almost invisible)
- Some areas should have a glass-like or holographic quality
- Add a very subtle vignette effect to draw focus to the center

## How to Use the Image
This image will be used as a background in the "Our Story" section of the company website. It will have text overlaid on it in a semi-transparent dark box, so the image should not be too busy in the center-left area. The image will be displayed in a rounded container with a subtle shadow effect.

## File Naming
Save the final image as: "about_our_story_bg.png" in the public/images/ directory.
